# Facing Emotions

## Earn Chavisa Rojratanadumrong

In our communication with others, the messages we send arenâ€™t just with words. 
To be accurate words only account for 7%, the rest are 55% of body language and 38% of voice intonation. 
This non-verbal communication and our behavior enable us to interpret emotions and enhance interpersonal relationships. 
This process gives us as humans with Emotional Intelligence which is considered as one of the important factors in the definition of being what we are as human.
What if Emotional Intelligence is ripped away from human-beings and reversely imprinted on machines?

In my code through 'keypress' the audiences's face are captured and sent to EmoVu API that detect emotion from facial expressions. 
The result is sorted to find the highest rank emotion and then give visual feedback according to that specific emotion.
